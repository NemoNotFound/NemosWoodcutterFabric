I love to create mods for Minecraft and wish to live off it one day, so I hope you like what I do. <br>
Either way feel free to give me your feedback and suggestions, either on my Discord or the [discussions](https://github.com/NemoNotFound/NemosWoodcutter/discussions/) :)

# Adding Woodcutting Recipes to Your Mod (1.21.2+)
## Data Generation
Instead of creating an instance of the RecipeGenerator in your RecipeProvider, create an instance of the WoodcutterGenerator.
There, you have all the methods you need to create a woodcutting recipe.

## Manually
Here is an example of the recipe json file:
```
{
  "type": "nemos-woodcutter:woodcutting",
  "ingredient": "minecraft:acacia_planks",
  "inputCount": 1,
  "result": {
    "count": 3,
    "id": "minecraft:acacia_sign"
  }
}
```
